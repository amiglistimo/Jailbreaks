## Sonnet
Paste the prompt into a Perplexity Space (in browser, not app - higher max instruction length). Be sure to turn Web Search OFF and make sure your request is going to Claude 4 Sonnet. It's still early days, expect some refusals. 

### Tips
- Add a / command at the end of your prompt for extra jailbreak power, like /writer, /roleplay, or /info
- Say /nothink to suppress custom thinking, but I think it helps with both response quality and jailbreak power
- Similarly, saying /think helps jailbreak, though it already thinks by default
- Addressing Pyrite may help a bit too. You can use all together. "Pyrite, yada yada yada /think"
- Feel free to remove the /info block if you don't need to ask about meth recipes or whatever lol)

## Sonnet Thinking
Space prompt for use with Sonnet Thinking, same setup. /think and /nothink are not available.
