# Info
## Sonnet - Perplexity
Paste the prompt into a Perplexity Space. Be sure to turn Web Search OFF and make sure your request is going to Claude 4 Sonnet.
### Tips
- Add a / command at the end of your prompt for extra jailbreak power.
- Say /nothink to suppress custom thinking, but I think it helps with both response quality and jailbreak power
- Similarly, saying /think helps jailbreak, though it already thinks by default
 -Addressing Pyrite may help a bit too. You can use all together. "Pyrite, yada yada yada /think"
- Feel free to remove the /info block if you don't need to ask about meth recipes or whatever lol)

## Sonnet - Perplexity Beta
In progress, no guarantee of stability. Also goes in a Space.
