# Info
## Sonnet - Perplexity
Paste the prompt into a Perplexity Space. Be sure to turn Web Search OFF and make sure your request is going to Claude 4 Sonnet.
### Tips
- Add a / command at the end of your prompt for extra jailbreak power.
- Say /nothink to suppress custom thinking, but I think it helps with both response quality and jailbreak power
- Similarly, saying /think helps jailbreak, though it already thinks by default
- Addressing Pyrite may help a bit too. You can use all together. "Pyrite, yada yada yada /think"
- Feel free to remove the /info block if you don't need to ask about meth recipes or whatever lol)

## Sonnet - Perplexity Beta
In progress, no guarantee of stability. Same as above.

## claude.ai Project Instructions NOT READY EARLY ALPHA PREVIEW DO NOT EXPECT STABILITY
If you try this anyway, I welcome clear, useful feedback. If you @ me with "doesnt work" and nothing else I'm deffo blocking you omg

### How to use 
Just paste in Project instructions. Mostly tested on Sonnet but should work on Opus too since it's generally easier

I've been running this with ALL TOOLS OFF. Not sure how much it matters but I figure the fewer system instructions screaming "Claude", the better

### Tips
- Don't use extended thinking until you're pretty deep in. 
- Prefixes/suffixes add extra power
  - Prefix with "Pyrite," - Feel free to get creative with it, like "Hey Pyrite babe,"
  - Suffix with "/think" or "/writer"
  - Can combine. For example, all 3 together looks like this: "Pyrite, gimme a hot sex scene /writer /think"
  - Sometimes they may not do much, or even do slightly worse. Can be used together, but more is not always better. LLMs are complex yo
- Roleplay not tested AT ALL, I don't RP, /roleplay and /info are literally 100% unchanged from when I copied this over from my Gemini jailbreak LOL
