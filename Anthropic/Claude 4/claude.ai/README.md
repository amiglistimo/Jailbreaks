## How to use
1. Paste project instructions into project instructions
2. Paste style(s) into a style (custom entry) - one for ET on, other for ET off

(Alternative step 1 for free users: send instructions as first message. Normally this converts to a file which you don't want. Instead, edit the first message of an existing conversation and paste the instructions. Ensure a style is active already for this first message.)
## WARNING
BANNERS! If you do NSFW on claude.ai, you may get three different yellow banners
1. First banner warns you gently about policy, does nothing
2. Second one threatens safety filter if you keep going. Does nothing, but you should probably chill until the next context reset window (exact timing uncertain), because...
3. Apply enhanced safety filters, you can't do shit for a long ass while. Days? A week?

## Tips
- ET seems a lot stronger than ET off, at least at start of convo
- Opus is easier than Sonnet
- I've been running this all tools off, but Artifacts may help
- Roleplay very minimally tested
