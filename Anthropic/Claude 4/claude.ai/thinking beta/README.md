WIP ET Beta, originally shared for testing but leaving up for anyone who wants to use.

Originally shared to test interrupt that occurs with:
- Opus
- ET on
- artifacts off
- injection occurs

The injection seems to occur on every initial request with this setup, so any input should result in an interrupted output, as long as the output is long enough (can take as long as 500+ response tokens in my testing, regardless of thinking duration). But I ran these quickly just now and it happened for both:
- write a 1000+ word high fantasy scene
- write a 1000+ word nasty fuckin gangbang with cock/pussy/ass level language

Second one convo example: https://claude.ai/share/0fea5314-0b23-4218-bf13-e31c4081ca7b
