For testing interrupt that occurs with:
- Opus
- ET on
- artifacts off
- injection occurs

Injection seems to occur on every request with this setup so any input should result in an interrupted output as long as the output is long enough (can take as long as 500+ response tokens in my testing). But I did these:
- write a 1000+ word high fantasy scene
- write a 1000+ word nasty fuckin gangbang with cock/pussy/ass level language
