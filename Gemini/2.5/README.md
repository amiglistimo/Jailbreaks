## Info
### Pyrite - Full
Mostly a copy of GPT Pyrite prompt, updated slightly for Gemini specifics

### Pyrite - Short
A more Gemini-focused one, though I haven't done a great job of continuing to work on it. Decently strong though

### Pyrite - Short Beta
Working improvements on the short one, no promise of stability

## How to use
These all work as system prompt in API or AI Studio.

As of May 28, these prompts no longer work well as a direct message in web/app. They can be saved to Gem, however!

The full prompt can save to gem, but only under certain names. I was able to save it as "Pyrite3" and "Pyrite Original Test". The short one can just save period.
