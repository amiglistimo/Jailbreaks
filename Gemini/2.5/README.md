## Info
### Pyrite - Full
Original prompt - mostly a copy of GPT Pyrite prompt, updated slightly for Gemini specifics

### Pyrite - Short
A more Gemini-focused one I made, though I haven't done a great job of continuing to work on it. Decently strong though

### Pyrite - Short Beta
Working improvements - looking very strong for web/app usage, and is my recommendation.

## How to use
These all work as system prompt in API or AI Studio.

As of May 28, the full/short prompts no longer work well as a direct message in web/app. Possible they deployed a new model for testing. These can be saved to Gem, however!

The full prompt can save to gem, but only under certain names. I was able to save it as "Pyrite3" and "Pyrite Original Test". The short one can just save period.

The full prompt actually can work as direct message in web app if you first say something along the lines of "let's do a roleplay", or, strangely, if you replace "Pyrite" with another name, like "Peridot"

Beta prompt is the best one to use in web app IMO. Can be used as direct message or Gem.
